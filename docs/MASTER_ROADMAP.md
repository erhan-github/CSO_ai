## 🚨 KNOWN GAPS (From GAPS.md)

### Critical Gaps to Address

| Gap | Current Grade | Impact | Priority |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **Context Awareness** | B | Experts don't see project-wide dependencies | High |
| **Speed** | C- | Sequential execution, no caching | High |
| **Routing** | B- | Regex-based, not intelligent | Medium |
| **Polyglot Support** | C | Poor support for Rust, Go, Ruby | Medium |
| **Auto-Fix** | F | No action, only complaints | Low |

### Remediation Plan

**Q2 2026**:
- [ ] Context-aware graph analysis (addresses Context gap)
- [ ] Async parallelism + caching (addresses Speed gap)
- [ ] LLM-based router (addresses Routing gap)

**Q3 2026**:

## 💰 UNICORN ECONOMICS (From UNICORN_STRATEGY.md)

### Intelligence Lifecycle
```
Local Brain (Privacy) → Cloud Voice (Intelligence) → Local Storage
```

### Strategic Units (SU)
- **1 SU** = 1 Specialized Expert Action
- **Computation** (Free): Regex, AST, type-checking
- **Intelligence** (Paid): LLM reasoning, expert verdicts

### Fraud Prevention
- **Central Oracle**: Cloud gateway is source of truth
- **Local Wallet**: Fast UX, but verified against gateway
- **Swiss Bank**: Hard-stop at zero balance
