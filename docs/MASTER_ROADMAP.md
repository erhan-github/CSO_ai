# Sidelith: The Heritage Roadmap (2026-2027) 📅

## 📊 Phase 1: The Tactical Wedge (0-6 Months)
**Goal**: Achieve 100% reliability as the "Invisible Expert" in the IDE.

| Milestone | Deliverable | ROI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic Unification** | Unified AST Graph for Python, TS, Go, Rust. | Deterministic forensic audits. |
| **Comment Miner** | Intelligent Intent Discovery from code comments. | Passive knowledge capture (0 user effort). |
| **PR Rationalization** | 100% automated decision logs for pull requests. | Save 5+ hours/week in manual reviews. |

---

## 🧠 Phase 2: The Organizational Memory (6-12 Months)
**Goal**: Transition from a local tool to a team-wide "Knowledge Ledger."

| Milestone | Deliverable | ROI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Heritage Search** | Historical 3D replay of logic evolution. | Instant onboarding for any repository. |
| **Team Synthesis** | Cross-repo "Wisdom Sync" via Sovereign Gateway. | Elimination of "Siloed Intelligence." |
| **IQ Benchmarking** | Industry-standard "Strategic IQ" grading. | Board-level visibility into engineering health. |

---

## 🏛️ Phase 3: The Autonomous Auditor (12-18 Months)
**Goal**: Proactive architectural drift detection and autonomous remediation.

| Milestone | Deliverable | ROI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Drift Alerts** | Real-time "Architectural Circuit Breaker" in the IDE. | 90% reduction in technical debt interest. |
| **Auto-Fixer Expert** | Autonomous remediation of forensic violations. | Automated compliance (SOC2) at scale. |
| **GNN Orchestration** | Graph Neural Network for deep logic prediction. | Predictive success for architectural shifts. |

---

## 🔮 Phase 4: The Cognitive Oracle (18-24 Months)
**Goal**: Mirror agentic reasoning via "Semantic Delta Extraction."

| Milestone | Deliverable | ROI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Workspace Delta Inference** | Detecting intent from cross-file changes (e.g. `fastapi` + `ui.py`). | 100% automated intent capture without comments. |
| **Strategic Predictive Engine** | Simulating the impact of a strategic shift across the org. | Real-time "What If" analysis for the C-suite. |
| **Recursive Documentation** | The codebase documents its own "Why" by observing our behavior. | Zero-effort documentation for the life of the project. |

---

## 🏁 The Final Verdict: "Clockwork Engineering"
By Phase 3, Sidelith becomes the **Operating System for Business Strategy.** Engineering teams no longer work in the dark; they work within a transparent, self-documenting, and self-healing **Logic Fabric**.
