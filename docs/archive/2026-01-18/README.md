## 📦 ARCHIVED DOCUMENTS

These documents represent previous implementation strategies that have been superseded by the current zero-storage intelligence system.

### Intelligence Planning (Superseded)

1. **INTELLIGENCE_CURATION_PLAN.md**
   - Original plan for daily signal curation with database storage
   - Superseded by: Zero-storage architecture with on-demand fetching

2. **MVP_INTELLIGENCE_STRATEGY.md**
   - MVP strategy with text analysis before LLM
   - Superseded by: Advanced scoring system with 7 quality improvements

3. **INTELLIGENCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md**
   - Initial implementation with local SQLite storage
   - Superseded by: Trending APIs + RSS feeds (no storage)

4. **FINAL_SUMMARY.md**
   - Early summary document
   - Superseded by: SESSION_SUMMARY.md (comprehensive overview)

5. **ZERO_STORAGE_INTELLIGENCE.md**
   - Detailed walkthrough of zero-storage approach
   - Superseded by: Feature READMEs (more focused documentation)

## 🔄 WHY ARCHIVED

These documents were created during the development process but are no longer the current implementation:

- **Storage approach changed**: From database storage to zero-storage
- **Architecture evolved**: From single fetcher to multi-source (trending + RSS)
- **Documentation improved**: From monolithic docs to focused READMEs
- **Quality enhanced**: From basic scoring to advanced 7-factor scoring

- [Current State](../../CURRENT_STATE.md)
- [Session Summary](../../SESSION_SUMMARY.md)
